# Blog or any other project

For deploying that project you should build a suitable docker image.

Name it 
- leon122/<project>:latest -- testing stuff locally in docker (e.g. docker-compose)
- leon122/<project>:kube-stage -- for testing on the staging environment (most of my stuff)
- leon122/<project>:kube-prod -- for deploy something productively
